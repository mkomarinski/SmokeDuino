SmokeDuino
==========

Control an electric smoker with an Arduino

TODOs:

Add some wireless code so you can monitor temperature remotely
 - bluetooth intially, WiFi later?

Add RTC code so you know how long it's been running
 - maybe some sort of alarm?
 - ordered some hardware and will try it out when it arrives
